# TCR-Antigen-Specificity-Resource
A resource for researchers studying TCR antigen specificity. Welcome to make your contributions to this repo!

## Database
### [VDJdb](https://vdjdb.cdr3.net/)
VDJdb is a curated database of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences with known antigen specificities. The primary goal of VDJdb is to facilitate access to existing information on T-cell receptor antigen specificities, i.e. the ability to recognize certain epitopes in a certain MHC contexts.

### [IEDB](https://www.iedb.org/)
The Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) is a freely available resource funded by NIAID. It catalogs experimental data on antibody and T cell epitopes studied in humans, non-human primates, and other animal species in the context of infectious disease, allergy, autoimmunity and transplantation. The IEDB also hosts tools to assist in the prediction and analysis of epitopes.

### [McPAS-TCR](http://friedmanlab.weizmann.ac.il/McPAS-TCR/)
McPAS-TCR is a manually curated catalogue of T cell receptor (TCR) sequences that were found in T cells associated with various pathological conditions in humans and in mice. It is meant to link TCR sequences to their antigen target or to the pathology and organ with which they are associated.
The database can be queried by disease condition, T cell type, tissue, epitope, source organism, MHC restriction, assay type and other criteria.
